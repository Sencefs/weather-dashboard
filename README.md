# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Features: You can see the current weather and future forecast of the city or place you search. The city is then added to your search history. When you view the present weather conditions of the city you search, you can see the name, date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and an icon representing the weather conditions. When you view the UV index, the severity of the index is indicated by the color shown. Green is for favorable, yellow is for moderate, and red is for severe. When you view the weather conditions for the place you searched, you can see the five-day forecast for that area which also shows the date, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and an icon representing the conditions. When you click on a previously searched area in the search history, it will show you the weather and five-day forecast for that area again.
